# Lending Club case study
Lending Club is a marketplace for personal loans that matches borrowers who are seeking a loan with investors looking to lend money and make a return. 
In this project, we aim to understand the driving factors (or driver variables) behind loan default, i.e. the variables which are strong indicators of default. The company can utilize this knowledge for its portfolio and risk assessment and help make better 
decisions while granting loans to the customers.
