# Lending Club case study
Lending Club is a marketplace for personal loans that matches borrowers who are seeking a loan with investors looking to lend money and make a return.

In this project, we aim to understand the driving factors (or driver variables) behind Loan Default, i.e. the variables which are strong indicators of Loan Default. The company can utilize this knowledge for its portfolio and risk assessment and help make better 
decisions while granting loans to the customers.

## General Information
When the company receives a loan application, the company has to make a decision for loan approval based on the applicant’s profile. 
Two types of risks are associated with the bank’s decision:

1) If the applicant is likely to repay the loan, then not approving the loan results in a loss of business to the company

2) If the applicant is not likely to repay the loan, i.e. he/she is likely to default, then approving the loan may lead to a financial loss for the company

The data given below contains information about past loan applicants and whether they ‘defaulted’ or not. The aim is to use Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) to identify patterns which indicate if a person is likely to default.

## Steps
1. Data Understanding
2. Data Cleaning and Preparation
3. Data Visualization
4. Univariate Analysis
5. Segmented Univariate Analysis
6. BiVariate Analysis
7. Results

## Conclusions
